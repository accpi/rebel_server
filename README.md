Rebel Coding Test - Express REST API

## Implementation

This is a simple one file Express REST API, the database (Postgres) is a naive implementation with all the data in one table.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app; open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser. If there's a different port specified in the `.env` file, it'll run through that port. This is important for Heroku.
